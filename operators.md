'-' (Subtraction) : It is used to subtract one number from another.

'\*' (Multiplication) : It is used to multiply two numbers.

'/'(Division) : Divides one number by another.

'%' (Modulus) : It return the remainder f a division.

## 2) COMPARISON OPERATORS

'==' (Equal to) : Checks if two values are equal.

'!=' (Not equal to) : checks if two values are not equal.

'-eq' (Equal to) : checks if two integers are equal.

'-ne' (Not equal to) : checks if two integers are not equal.

'-lt' (Less than) : checks if an integer is less than another.

'-le' (Less than or equal to) : checks if an integer is less than or equal to another.

'-gt' (Greater than) : checks if an integer is greater than another.

'-ge' (greater than or equal to) : checks if an integer is greater than or equal to another.

## 3) STRING OPERATORS

'=' (Equal to) : checks if two strings are equal.

'!=' (Not equal to) : checks if two strngs are not equal.

'-z' (zero length) : checks if a string is an empty string.

'-n' : checks if a string is not empty.

## 4) LOGICAL OPERATORS

'&&' (Logical AND) : performs an action if both conditions are true.

'||' (Logical OR) : performs an action if at least one condition is true.

'!' (Logical NOT) : does the inverse of the result of a condition.
